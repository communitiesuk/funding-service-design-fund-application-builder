<p>You should use existing templates for standard application questions. For example, all
    grant applications should collect organisation and risk information in the same way.</p>
<p>If your application needs questions specific to the grant, you can create a new template by:</p>
<ol>
    <li>designing the template in Form Designer</li>
    <li>downloading the template</li>
    <li>uploading the template to Fund application builder</li>
</ol>
